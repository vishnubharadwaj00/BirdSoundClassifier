# BirdSoundClassifier
fast.ai's courses and software make it extremely easy to start working on difficult projects very quickly. This is just another example of that.  

This is a Bird Sound Classifying Deep Learning model, which takes in bird sounds, converts them into images (spectograms), and then classifies those images based on what type of bird call it is.  

The data is from: https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4g8b7/1  

There are 6 types of bird calls: distance,hat,kackle,song,stack,tet.  

This model gets around 80% accuracy, which is not bad at all for something that relies on so many different factors.
